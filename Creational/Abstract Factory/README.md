# 🧙‍♂️ Abstract Factory Pattern in C#

## 📌 What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?

The **Abstract Factory** is a **creational design pattern** that lets you **produce families of related objects** without specifying their concrete classes.

It's like a factory **of factories**. Instead of creating objects directly, clients use a factory interface that creates related objects consistently across families.

---

## ✅ You should use the Abstract Factory Pattern when:

- You need to **create families of related objects** that must be used together.
- You want to **ensure consistency** among related product objects.
- You want to follow **Open/Closed Principle** — easily extend product families without modifying code.
- You want to avoid binding your code to specific classes.

## 🧠 Real-World Use Cases


```
| Use Case                       | Description                                                                

|🧾 Cross-platform Toolkits      | Provide platform-specific UI elements for Windows, Mac, Linux
|🛒 E-Commerce Platforms         | Generate product variants for region-specific offerings
|🏭 UI Themes                    |  Produce families of UI components (Dark Button, Dark Textbox, etc.) 

```
## 🎮 Real World Example — Game World 


This project demonstrates the **Abstract Factory Design Pattern** using a creative **Game World** scenario.
Each game world — such as **Medieval**, **Sci-Fi**, **Fantasy**, and **Zombie** — has its own types of **Heroes** and **Weapons**, but the game engine (client) interacts only with abstract interfaces. This keeps each world **modular**, **interchangeable**, and **loosely coupled** with the client logic.

## 🏗️ Structure

### ✅ Abstract Factory
- `GameWorldFactory`: Declares methods to create abstract products (`Hero`, `Weapon`).

### ✅ Abstract Products
- `Hero`: Defines the interface for the hero character.
- `Weapon`: Defines the interface for weapons.

### ✅ Concrete Factories
- `MedievalFactory`: Creates a `Knight` and a `Sword`.
- `SciFiFactory`: Creates a `SpaceSoldier` and a `LaserGun`.
- `FantasyFactory`: Creates a `Wizard` and a `MagicStaff`.
- `ZombieFactory`: Creates a `Survivor` and a `Shotgun`.

### ✅ Concrete Products
- `Knight`, `SpaceSoldier`, `Wizard`, `Survivor`: Each is a specific `Hero` implementation.
- `Sword`, `LaserGun`, `MagicStaff`, `Shotgun`: Each is a specific `Weapon` implementation.

# 🟢  Abstract Factory Pattern Pros & Cons


```
|            Pros                                        |                               Cons

| Decouples client code from concrete classes            | Can introduce complexity with many interfaces/classes

| Easy to switch between different product families      | Can lead to rigid design if overused

|Promotes Single Responsibility & Open/Closed Principles.
