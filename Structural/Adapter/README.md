# Adapter Design Pattern ðŸ”Œ

## ðŸ“– Overview
The **Adapter Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together.  
It acts as a **bridge** between two classes, converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.  

This is especially useful when you want to reuse existing classes but their interfaces donâ€™t match the one your system requires.

---

## âœ… You Should Use the Adapter Pattern When:

- You need to integrate **incompatible systems**.  
- You want to reuse existing classes that donâ€™t have the required interface.  
- You need to connect **legacy code** with new systems.  
- You want to follow the **Open/Closed Principle** (extend functionality without modifying existing code).

## ðŸ§  Use Cases of the Adapter Pattern







```
Use Case	                         |                  Description

ðŸ”Œ Power Plug Converters             | Convert European plugs to fit US sockets (travel adapters).
ðŸ’³ Payment Gateway Integration       | Adapt new payment APIs into existing systems.
ðŸ“‚ File Conversion Tools	          | Convert between JSON, XML, or CSV formats transparently.
ðŸŽ® Game Controllers                  | Use different controller types (Xbox, PlayStation) with the same game.
ðŸ“¡ Legacy System Integration	     | Connect old APIs or databases to modern applications.

## ðŸš€ Real-World Example: ðŸ”Œ Power Plug Adapter

Imagine traveling with your **European laptop charger** (two round pins) to the **USA**, where wall sockets accept only **flat pins**.  
You cannot plug your device directly, but a **travel adapter** solves this by converting the plug shape while still delivering power.  

This is exactly what the **Adapter Pattern** does â€” it adapts one interface to another without changing existing code.

### ðŸ”‘ Components:
- **Target (US Socket):** Defines the interface expected by the client.  
- **Adaptee (European Plug):** Existing class with an incompatible interface.  
- **Adapter (EuropeanToUSAdapter):** Bridges the gap between `EuropeanPlug` and `USSocket`.  
- **Client (Traveler/Device):** Uses the adapter to connect incompatible systems.

## âœ… Key Features

- âœ… Connects incompatible interfaces without modifying them.  
- âœ… Encourages reusability of existing code.  
- âœ… Provides a **flexible and decoupled design**.  
- âœ… Helps integrate **legacy systems** with modern applications.

|Allows reuse of existing classes                           | Can add extra complexity if overused
| Promotes loose coupling between systems                   | May reduce performance due to extra translation layer
| Bridges legacy and modern systems efficiently             | Too many adapters can make code harder to maintain
