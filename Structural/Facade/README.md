# 🏢 Facade Pattern in C#

## 📌 What is the Facade Pattern?

The **Facade** design pattern provides a **simplified interface** to a larger body of code, such as a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the system and provides a cleaner, easier-to-use interface for the client.

It is commonly used when:
- You want to **hide internal complexity** from the client.
- You want to **organize complex subsystems** with a clear entry point.
- You want to **decouple** client code from multiple subsystems.

## 🧠 Use Cases of the Facade Pattern
```
| Use Case                  | Description                                                                 |
| 🏦 Banking Systems        | A single method to apply for a loan, internally calling credit check, employment verification, etc. |
| 📦 E-commerce Checkout    | One place to call payment, shipping, invoice generation, and email notification. |
| 🖥️ Operating Systems      | High-level APIs like "open a file" that hide multiple system calls.         |
| 🏠 Smart Home Systems     | Pressing "Movie Mode" may dim lights, lower blinds, and turn on the TV.    |

## 🚀 Real-World Example: Mortgage Application

In this example, we simulate a **mortgage application system**, where a user can apply for a mortgage loan. Instead of requiring the user to interact with each individual service (credit check, employment verification, bank balance check), they interact with a single `MortgageApplication` class — the facade.

Under the hood, the Facade coordinates multiple subsystems:
- ✅ `CreditService`
- ✅ `EmploymentService`
- ✅ `BankService`

The goal is to simplify the application process from the user’s point of view, while keeping subsystems decoupled.

## ✅ Key Features

- ✅ Provides a unified interface to multiple complex services  
- ✅ Reduces coupling between client code and subsystems  
- ✅ Simplifies usage for the end user  
- ✅ Improves maintainability and readability  
- ✅ Promotes separation of concerns

## 🎯 Facade Pattern Pros & Cons
```
| Pros                                                              | Cons                                                                   
| You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.     | May introduce a god object if too much logic is pushed into the facade 
| Makes the system easier to use and reduces learning curve         | Can lead to less flexible designs if overused                      
| Improves readability and maintainability                          | Subsystems may still be tightly coupled internally                 
| Encourages layering and better organization                       | Extra abstraction layer may become redundant for simple systems
